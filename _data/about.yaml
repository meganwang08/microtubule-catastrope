  Modeling Microtubule Time to Catastrophe

Abstract: >
  Microtubules are fundamental parts of eukaryotic cells and are necessary for
  many essential cellular processes. For example, they form the cytoskeleton to
  provide structure and shape to cells, allow intracellular transport, facilitate
  cell division by pulling chromosomes apart, form cilia and flagella, and much more.
  They are assembled through an event called nucleation by microtubule-organizing
  centers (MTOC) in which tubulin monomers are added on successively, causing
  lengthening of the microtubule. The microtubule dynamically switches between
  growing and shrinking. If the tubulin monomer is bound to GTP, this tubulin is
  considered stable and will stay on the microtubule, promoting further growth.
  On the other hand, if the tubulin is a GDP-bound tubulin due the GTP becoming
  hydrolyzing, the tubulin monomer will be unstable and fall off the microtubule.
  The result is rapid depolymerization of the microtubule, and this switch
  between growing and shrinking is termed “a catastrophe”. The kinetics of microtubule
  catastrophe are still largely unknown as there are likely to be multiple factors
  that modulate the mechanism and duration of this event. We contribute to elucidating
  these unknowns by attempting to understand how microtubule catastrophe time may be modeled.
  Here we analyze the time it takes for catastrophe to occur after growth begins of
  microtubules exposed to fluorescently labelled tubulin as well as various
  concentrations of tubulin in vitro, obtaining the data from Jonathon Howard’s Lab
  at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. We propose a
  model that we think may be appropriate to model microtubule catastrophe and compare
  it to a Gamma Distribution which other groups have proposed as the model. We
  ultimately observe that our proposed model is not more appropriate for microtubule
  catastrophe, disproving at least one theory of the mechanism of microtubule catastrophe.

Experimental Methods:  >
  The Howard Lab studied the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe by imaging microtubules
  with TIRF microscopy and then recorded the times it took for the catastrophe event to
  be triggered after growth began. TIRF microscopy is effective as it allows for
  selectivity of which molecules will fluoresce, and the Howard Lab leveraged this
  by studying microtubules exposed to Alexa 488 labeled tubulin. Decreasing fluorescence
  intensity will indicate catastrophe has occurred, and the time it took for this event
  to occur was measured. To ensure this method of imaging did not alter microtubule dynamics,
  they compared time to catastrophe for microtubules with labeled tubulin and unlabeled
  tubulin (imaged using DIC microscopy). Then, after concluding fluorescent labeling indeed
  does not affect time to catastrophe, the Howard Lab studied time to catastrophe depending
  on different concentrations of labeled tubulin. All of the data was made available to us
  via Justin Bois.
