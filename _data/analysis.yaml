Fluorescent Labeling Does Not Affect Time to Catastrophe: >
  We compared the labeled vs unlabeled tubulin to confirm fluorescent labeling
  indeed doesn’t affect time to catastrophe by plotting the ECDFs (with confidence
  intervals) of the provided data of times to catastrophe. We display the ECDFs
  here and the fluorescent labeling does not appear to make a difference on the
  onset of catastrophe as the ECDF plots do not deviate significantly from each
  other. Then, we computed 95% confidence intervals for the plug-in estimate of the
  mean time to catastrophe for labeled and unlabeled tubulin and found there is
  very strong overlap of the confidence intervals. This indicates that the labeled
  and unlabeled tubulin result in similar mean time to catastrophe. We also conducted
  a permutation test to test our hypothesis that fluorescent labeling does not affect
  microtubule catastrophe dynamics. The test statistic we chose was the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  (K-S) statistic which is the maximal distance between the ECDFs of two samples. This
  is a reasonable and commonplace measure used to determine how different the two
  distributions are. For this test statistic, "at least as extreme as" means that
  the K-S statistic is greater than what was observed. We computed the p-value of this
  test to be p = 0.26204 >  $\alpha$ = 0.05. This indicates it is possible to observe this test statistic under
  the null hypothesis that there is no difference in labeled and unlabeled catastrophe
  times and because we saw from our graphical analysis that the two distributions look
  very similar, we conclude that the measured data for labeled and unlabeled tubulin are very
  similarly distributed and can be viewed as identical for analytical purposes. Moving
  forward, we only analyze the time to catastrophe of microtubules growing with fluorescently
  labelled tubulin. We include the source code to generate this [the plot](https://meganwang08.github.io//microtubule-catastrophe/software/EDA_fluorescent_labeling.py)
  as well as the [mentioned analysis](https://meganwang08.github.io//microtubule-catastrophe/software/MLE_of_microtubules.py %}).

Proposing a Novel Distribution to Model Time to Catastrophe: >
  Although previous work by multiple authors including Gardner et al. have asserted
  that microtubule time to catastrophe may be approximated by a Gamma distribution,
  we are unsure this is truly the most appropriate model. This would imply that
  multiple chemical processes with similar rates must occur to trigger microtubule
  catastrophe. Many factors are known to be important in microtubule catastrophe
  dynamics/kinetics. For example, whether or not there is a GTP cap “protecting”
  the microtubule from depolymerization might vary. There is not enough evidence
  to conclude that time to catastrophe follows a Gamma distribution. We propose
  an alternative model where we postulate that two biochemical processes will
  occur in sequence, triggering catastrophe. These processes are both Poisson
  processes with rates $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, respectively. We use a random number
  generator to simulate 150 catastrophe events according to this model with various pairs
  of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. We include the source code to generate the [left plots below](https://meganwang08.github.io//microtubule-catastrophe/software/poisson_modeling_microtubule.py).
  We note that the more $\beta_2$ is greater than $\beta_1$, the steeper the ECDF is. This makes
  sense because if the processes occurred faster, catastrophe would be triggered more quickly.

Analytical derivation of time to catastrophe model: >
  We analytically derive the distribution for the time to catastrophe, finding the
  PDF and CDF for this distribution. We then compare this analytical CDF with ECDFs
  from our previous simulation to confirm that they match and we see that the CDF is
  correct. We include the source code to generate the [right plot above](https://meganwang08.github.io//microtubule-catastrophe/software/poisson_modeling_microtubule.py).
  We can then use this analytical PDF or CDF to compare this model to a Gamma distribution to see
  which is more appropriate to model time to catastrophe.

Comparing Our Proposed Distribution With a Gamma Distribution: >
  Next, we will analytically compare the distribution we propose consisting of two
  consecutive cellular processes (Poisson) with a gamma distribution. We display
  plots of predictive ECDFs of both distributions overlaid with the ECDF of the
  measured data of microtubule time to catastrophe for 12uM of fluorescently labeled
  tubulin (made available to us via Justin Bois). We find that the ECDF of the Gamma
  distribution actually seems to match with the measured ECDF compared to that of our
  proposed distribution. Furthermore, we also plot the difference between the predictive
  ECDF and the measured ECDF to more clearly see how far apart the ECDF values of the
  predictive ECDFs are from the actual data points. We find that the difference between
  our proposed distribution and the measured data is indeed greater than that of the Gamma
  distribution. Then, we use the AIC, which can be broadly understood as an estimate of a
  quantity related to the distance between the true generative distribution and the model
  distribution. Given two models, the one with the smaller AIC value is likely closer to the
  true generative distribution. We then compute the AIC for both and indeed find that our
  proposed model consisting of two Poisson processes (AIC value on the order of $10^{-11}$) is
  not as likely to be as close to the measured data as the Gamma Distribution.

Summary: >
  From the data provided to us by the Howard Lab, we were able to compare a novel
  model of microtubule catastrophe to the Gamma Distribution. Our novel model is
  defined as two sequential biochemical processes which are Poisson and trigger
  microtubule catastrophe. Through graphical and statistical analysis, we conclude
  that our proposed model is not as appropriate to model time to catastrophe of
  microtubules compared to the Gamma Distribution.
